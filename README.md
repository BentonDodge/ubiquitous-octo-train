This is my *First Discord Bot* and therefore may be buggy and overall bad.
But if I am able to learn from the mistakes I make here, I hope to better myself in completeing my epic and totally realistic goal of becoming the best Developer

In This Discord Bot I am hoping to have Games, battles, gambiling and overall multiple tasks that the members can enjoy:
Although this discord bot is limited memeber wise because all of their usernames and cash is stored in a text file. The Bot should reward members for being apart of the server and therefore elder.

Commands:
  Technical Commands:
    "!ShutDown"-Turns the bot off and posts the leaderboard to the server
    "!"YearlyMutiplier"-Once followed by "True" or "False" it will toggle if yearly multiplier is active(NOTE: IT WILL RESET EVERYONE'S MULTIPLIER)
  Game Commands:
    "$CloseGames"-stops all games
    "$BlackJack"-Starts a game of Black Jack
