This is my *First Discord Bot* and therefore may be buggy and overall bad.
But if I am able to learn from the mistakes I make here, I hope to better myself in completeing my epic and totally realistic goal of becoming the best Developer

In This Discord Bot I am hoping to have Games, battles, gambiling and overall multiple tasks that the members can enjoy:
Although this discord bot should also have a hash map of each persons ID/Name, and Cash. The Bot should reward members for being apart of the server and therefore elder.

Instead of using a database or anything outside of the bot to store data it will use the discord server itself
